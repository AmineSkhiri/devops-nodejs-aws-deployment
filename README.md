- ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Terraform for IaC
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- CloudWatch for monitoring and logs

## Deployment Flow

1. Push code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions builds Docker image and pushes to ECR
3. ECS automatically deploys the updated container
4. ALB exposes the app on the internet
